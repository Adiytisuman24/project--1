To use the ARKit plugin in your Flutter app, you will need to add the arkit_plugin package as a dependency in your pubspec.yaml file. Here is an example of how your pubspec.yaml file might look like with the arkit_plugin package added:


dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  arkit_plugin: ^0.4.0

You also need to add the following permission 
to your AndroidManifest.xml file

and this to your Info.plist file

Code:



         <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
          <string>This app needs access to the camera to function</string>




This code creates an AR app using the ARKitSceneView widget provided by the arkit_plugin package, which allows you to easily display an AR scene in a Flutter app. It also has an appbar with an icon button to pick an image from the gallery and set it as the background image. The skybox property of the ARKitSceneView widget is used to set the background image.
This code uses the mongo_dart package to connect to a MongoDB database and provide basic CRUD operations for a 'user' collection. The connect() method connects to the database using the MongoDB connection string, and creates an index on the email field to make sure it is unique. The insertUser() method inserts a new user document into the 'user' collection. The getUser() method finds and returns a user document with a matching email address.
There are several ways to secure data in a MongoDB database, some of the common methods include:

Authentication: Make sure to use a unique username and password combination for your MongoDB server and database to prevent unauthorized access.

Encryption: Use encryption to secure data in transit and at rest. MongoDB supports various encryption options, including client-side encryption, field-level encryption, and encryption-at-rest.

Access control: Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to the database and limit the actions that users can perform.

Auditing: Enable auditing to track and log all database activity, such as read and write operations.
